## Collections

Template based collections are defined in the standard library (`std::collections`); The data here is stored on the heap and hence the size of the data can be grown / shrunk at runtime. Some of the most common collections are `Vec` which allows you to store data contiguously and `String` which is a sequence of characters and `HashMap` a key-value pair accessed by hashing. There are others like `VecDequeue`, `LinkedList`, `BTreeMap`, `HashSet` etc.
