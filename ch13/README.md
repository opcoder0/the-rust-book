## Functional language features: Iterators and Closures

Programming in functional style often includes -

- Using functions as values by passing them in arguments
- Returning them from other functions
- Assigning them to variables for later execution 

and so on. 

## Topics covered

- _Closures_, a function-like construct you can store in a variable.
- _Iterators_, a way of processing a series of elements
- How to use Closures and Iterators to improve the I/O project (in Chapter 12)
- The performance of Closures and Iterators.

Mastering Closures and Iterators are part of writing idiomatic Rust code.
